- [x] Automatic analysis
- [x] Color-coded results (green/red)
- [x] Similarity percentages
- [x] Custom review testing
- [x] Responsive design

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Check files exist
ls -la README.md docker-compose.yml Dockerfile .env.example

# 2. Check Docker build
docker compose build

# 3. Check structure
python3 test_app.py

# 4. Start services
docker compose up -d

# 5. Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# 6. Test API
curl http://localhost:8080/api/analyze/hotel_1

# 7. View UI
# Open http://localhost:8080 in browser

# 8. Check logs
docker compose logs app

# 9. Stop services
docker compose down
```
